# Jira Comment Visibility

## Purpose

This extension relieves the user of having to remember to change the visibility of jira comments.

## State

The extension is in active development and can be considered unfinished, buggy and slow as of now.
Use at your own (probably small) risk.

I'm a backend developer so my JS skills may not be up to par with best practices and conventions. Don't judge pls.

## Contributing

Feature requests can be made by opening up an issue in this repository.

Any contribution that is closer to coding advice, please express via PR :)

There's probably TODOs scattered everywhere, feel free to take one up.
Shoot me a message that you're doing it though, to prevent us from doing the same thing twice.

## Installing

As I'm currently refusing to pay Google $$$ to be able to upload this to the Chrome Web Store you will have to install this manually.
